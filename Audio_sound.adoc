=== sndiod

Note that, to get actual 24-bit precision, the full signal
processing chain must use 24-bit precision, so sndiod must be
recompiled with:

        make COPTS=-DADATA_BITS=24
To record 24-bit with no
 precision loss, you have to recompile aucat in 24-bit mode.
 
   make COPTS=-DADATA_BITS=24
